# HCPSMSHS_FACE_ATTENDANCE_SYSTEM

## Description
This is a Face Attendance System with Temperature designed for the school Honorato C. Perez Sr. Memorial Science High School, the project is a web application made possible by streamlit and other libraries.

## Setup Instructions

### Temperature Sensor Setup
1. Download the `Adafruit_MLX90614` library from the Arduino IDE.
2. Install the library by navigating to `Sketch -> Include Library -> Manage Libraries` in the Arduino IDE and searching for `Adafruit_MLX90614`. Click on the library and select "Install".
3. Connect the temperature sensor to your Arduino board as per the provided circuit diagram.

### Library Dependencies Setup
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Create a virtual environment to isolate the project dependencies. Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command to create a virtual environment:

- For Windows:
  ```
  myenv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- For macOS/Linux:
  ```
  source myenv/bin/activate
  ```
5. Once the virtual environment is activated, run the following command to install the required libraries mentioned in the `requirements.txt` file:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
